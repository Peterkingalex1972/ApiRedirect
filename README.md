# API Redirect

A simple api redirect :)

A improvement from [NodeApiRedirect](https://github.com/mozartdiniz/NodeAPIRedirect).

## How to use

Just read `properties.sample.json` and understand.

If you using for client side development, needed a url to your
`index.html` file, because all requests at root path are redirected to
your api.

## How to run

```bash
node server.js
```

You can pass host address as a parameter also:

```bash
node server.js http://anotherdomain.test.com
```
